# Elm Architecture Tutorial written in JS #

## What ##

I'm writing the [Elm Architecture Tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial) for better or for worse to a version in JS using Rx, React, Ramda and Immutable.

## Running the examples ##

Just execute `npm run ex<example number>` and got to `http://localhost:8080`. Make sure to `npm install` at least once before doing it.

All the examples are under the `examples` directory.

## Why? ##

Because I find it (the architecture pattern) extremely simple to use and **understand**. I've been trying to use React along with Redux but I find those harder to understand in a real-world app.
